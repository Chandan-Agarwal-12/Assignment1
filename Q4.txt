Overview
This project simulates a metro system with functionalities for user management and journey planning. It uses basic data structures and algorithms to handle user operations and find routes between stations.

Workflow
Initialization and User Interaction:

The program starts by displaying a welcome message and metro system map.
Users are prompted to either log in or sign up.
User Management:

If logging in, users provide credentials, and the system verifies them.
If signing up, the system generates a new user ID and card number, then stores this information.
Journey Planning:

Users can query routes between stations.
The program offers multiple route options based on:
All possible paths.
Path with the maximum number of stations.
Path with the minimum number of stations.
Shortest distance.
Path crossing a specified station.
Fare Calculation:

The program calculates the fare based on the distance between stations.
It checks the user's balance and prompts for an update if necessary.
Display Results:

The system displays the selected path, distance, estimated travel time, and fare.
Updates the user's balance after fare deduction.
Code Structure
Headers and Libraries:

cpp
Copy code
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
Uses the <bits/stdc++.h> header for a wide range of C++ standard libraries.
Classes:

station:
Stores station names and provides a method to calculate fare based on station number.
user:
Manages user credentials and metro card balance. Provides methods to display details and update balance.
Functions:

populatestation(station &metroSystem):

Initializes station names in a unordered_map.
findAllPaths(int source, int destination, unordered_map<int, set<pair<int, int>>> &adjList):

Performs depth-first search (DFS) to find all paths from source to destination.
preparelist(unordered_map<int, set<pair<int, int>>> &adjlist):

Populates adjacency list with graph edges and distances.
print(unordered_map<int, set<pair<int, int>>> adjlist):

Prints the adjacency list representing the metro network.
shortestdistance(unordered_map<int, set<pair<int, int>>> adjlist, int source):

Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance from source to all other nodes.
convertToStandardTime(float totalHours):

Converts travel time from hours to a standard time format (HH:MM
).
saveUserCount(int count) and loadUserCount():

Save and load the number of users to and from a file.
saveUserDetails(user userDetails[], int count) and loadUserDetails(user userDetails[], int count):

Save and load user details to and from a file.
main() Function:

Displays the metro system information.
Handles user login/sign-up and updates user information accordingly.
Allows users to choose a journey option and displays results.
Key Components
Data Structures:

unordered_map<int, string>: Maps station numbers to names.
unordered_map<int, set<pair<int, int>>>: Represents the adjacency list of the metro network.
vector<vector<int>>: Stores all possible paths found by DFS.
Algorithms:

Depth-First Search (DFS): Used to find all paths between stations.
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Used to find the shortest path based on distance.
File I/O:

Manages user data and count persistence using text files.
Summary
This metro system project integrates user management with journey planning functionalities using graph algorithms. It demonstrates the use of C++ standard libraries, file handling, and fundamental algorithms to create a simple yet functional metro simulation system.
